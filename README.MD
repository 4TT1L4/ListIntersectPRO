### ListIntersect PRO
ListIntersect PRO is a simple application using JavaFX and RxJava. It may be build using Gradle.

I have also implemented a few unit tests using JUnit to make sure that the most critical parts also work properly including the corner cases and that I did not forget about some special cases.

After extracting the attached zip file you should be able to start the application by executing simply gradle run:
